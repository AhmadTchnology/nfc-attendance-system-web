# Pushing to GitHub Instructions

You've successfully initialized a Git repository for your NFC Attendance System. Follow these steps to push it to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the '+' icon in the top right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository (e.g., "nfc-attendance-system")
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
6. Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing repository. Run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# Replace the URL with your GitHub repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/AhmadTchnology/nfc-attendance-system-web.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files now on GitHub

## 4. Future Changes

For future changes, use these commands:

```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes
git push
```

Congratulations! Your NFC Attendance System is now on GitHub and can be accessed from any device with internet access.
